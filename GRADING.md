# Pong Feedback

##### Your task was to create your own version of the classic Pong game.

# Planning and Documentation

- [x] UML diagram present
- [x] Pseudocode/flowchart for collision detection algorithm

**Notes:** Pseudocode is hard to read but the UML looks promising with the classes that were identified. 

# Gameplay

#### Basic Requirements: At Good Standard

- [x] Working menu screen
- [x] 2 player game
- [ ] Collision detection implemented
- [x] Paddle movement
- [x] Scoring system

#### Other Functionality

- [x] Win and lose states
- [x] Replay options
- [ ] Working extensions to the base requirements

**Notes:** Game is playable but not very complete. There are issues with the collision system as well as the paddles moving out of the play-area. The ball moves very slowly and the game is not very enjoyable to play. The paddles move smoothly and are one of the positives. 

# Implementation

- [ ] Well structured and easy to follow
- [x] Correct use of the coding standard
- [ ] Good use of object orientated design
- [ ] No memory leaks present
- [x] Use of delta time
- [ ] Passed Travis build checks

**Notes:** Some good and some bad. There's an attempt at some class design, but it's never probably made use of. The code-base needs a general refactoring to make it easier to read. Memory is also being leaked. 

# Marking

Your grade and the breakdown is shown below. The weightings for each component are shown in brackets.

| Component                                           | MARKS       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Problem analysis (UML, pseudo-code/flowchart) (10%) | 52.00%      |
| Playability and runs as expected (50%)              | 47.75%      |
| Technical implementation (40%)                      | 44.25%      |
|                                                     | ----------- |
| **Total**                                           | **46.78%**  |

The three components total 100%. 
This assignment contributes **20%** of your portfolio mark.

#### Additional Feedback

> A very basic and buggy version of Pong. The code-base shows some attempt at proper design but is underdeveloped.
